**SolidWorks Mini Projects**
This repository contains a collection of SolidWorks mini projects. Each project focuses on creating a 3D model using SolidWorks CAD software. These projects serve as examples and learning resources for SolidWorks enthusiasts.

**Project List**
1. Ball Bearing
Description: A ball bearing is a type of rolling-element bearing that serves three main functions while it facilitates motion: it carries loads, reduces friction and positions moving machine parts. Ball bearings use balls to separate two “races,” or bearing rings, to reduce surface contact and friction across moving planes.

2. Brakes
Description: A 3D model of a disc brake system.
Files: Brakes.SLDPRT
3. Coca Cola
Description: A 3D model of a Coca Cola Cap.
Files: Coca Cola.SLDPRT
4. PowerBank
Description: A 3D model of a power bank.
Files: PowerBank.SLDPRT
6. Rack Slider
Description: A 3D model of a rack slider mechanism. Rack and pinion steering uses a gear-set to convert the circular motion of the steering wheel into the linear motion required to turn the wheels. It also provides a gear reduction, so turning the wheels is easier.

**Getting Started**
To get started with these SolidWorks mini projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidworks-mini-projects.git
2. Install SolidWorks on your computer. You can obtain a license or trial version from the official SolidWorks website.
3. Open SolidWorks and navigate to the project folder within the repository.
4. Explore the projects by opening the project files (.SLDPRT or .SLDASM) using SolidWorks.


Enjoy exploring SolidWorks and creating amazing 3D models with these mini projects!
